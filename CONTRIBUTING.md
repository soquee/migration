## Submitting Patches

To submit a patch, first learn to use `git send-email` by reading
[git-send-email.io], then read the SourceHut [mailing list etiquette] guide.
You can send patches to my general purpose patches [mailing list].

Please prefix the subject with `[PATCH migration]`.
To configure your checkout of this repo to always use the correct prefix and
send to the correct list cd into the repo and run:

    git config sendemail.to ~samwhited/patches@lists.sr.ht
